#   JAWS settings for math support

This group’s efforts are focused on evaluating how well the Microsoft Equations work in Word for screen reader users. To avoid stumbling across known limitations in screen readers, please use the following:

•	Windows 10 or Windows 11
•	JAWS Version 2026.2512.50 or later
•	For earlier versions, MathCAT enabled in the JAWS “Early Adopter Program” dialog

## JAWS Settings for versions earlier than 2026

Enabling MathCAT
MathCAT is enabled in Jaws version 2026 and later. In previous versions MathCAT needs to be enabled in the JAWS “Early Adopter Program” dialog
To enable MathCAT in Jaws versions before 2026 do the following:
1.	Open JAWS
2.	Open the “Early Adopter Program” dialog from "Options" > "Early Adopter Program..."
3.	Make sure the “MathCAT” checkbox is checked
4.	Activate the “OK” button to close the dialog
5.	restart JAWS
Note: The above 5 steps are required only when you have an older version of Jaws. Starting with Jaws version 2026, MathCAT is enabled by default.


## MathCAT Settings
To access the math settings in JAWS:
1.	Open the JAWS Settings Center. It can be accessed from the JAWS dialog via menu at “Utilities” > “Settings Center”
2.	Find the Math settings by searching for “Math” in the search box
3.	In the search results list box, navigate the tree to the “Math Verbosity” entry
4.	Switch to the “Speech” page in the dialog by pressing ‘F6’
5.	Configure the Speech settings to the following:
i.	Speech Style: ClearSpeak

## To Copy a Math Expression with JAWS (MathCAT)
When you reach a math expression, it should be read aloud followed by the words “Math Content”. To copy the expression:
•	Press “Enter” to bring up the “Math Viewer”. This will appear as a new window that pops up
•	After it speaks all the new window information, JAWS should speak the first term of the expression
•	Use the up arrow key until the entire expression is spoken aloud or you hear “Zoomed out all the way”
•	Press “control + c”. You should hear JAWS say “Copied selection to clipboard”
•	Press “Escape” to close the “Math Viewer” window

Note: With MathML in the clipboard, you will be able to paste the math into  a Microsoft Word document.
