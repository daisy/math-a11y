# Recommended Microsoft Word 365 Settings for Using the Equation Editor with Screen Readers
Last updated: February 28, 2026

## Background

People who use screen readers can create mathematical  expressions by using linear input. For example, \sqrt 4 = 2 is the linear expression that can produce the professional appearance of the "square root of four equals two."  Almost all math can be produced in this way. This document identifies the recommended settings in Microsoft Word when using a screen reader.

Most global Word Options apply to all new documents you create.
When you change settings in File > Options, you’re typically adjusting application‑wide preferences. These include things like:
 * Proofing settings (AutoCorrect, spelling/grammar options)
 * Save settings (default file format, AutoRecover intervals)
 * Display settings
  Advanced editing behavior
 • Accessibility options
These are stored in your user profile (usually in the Windows registry and/or the Normal template, depending on the setting).

We will be  making changes in the options and in the Word equation editor settings. Open a new blank word file.


## Enable Math AutoCorrect Everywhere 
1. Open a Word document on your Windows device, then press ALT + F to open the File menu.
2. Press T for Options then Press p  for Proofing.
3.  Tab to AutoCorrect Options and press Enter.
5.  Shift + tab several times and arrow over to get to the Math AutoCorrect tab.
6.  There are many options. The ones you want to check are: 
* Check - Use Math AutoCorrect rules outside of math regions.
* Check -Replace text as you type.
This makes typing math much faster and avoids hunting through menus. If this interferes with your screen reader, you can leave it unchecked.

Tab to OK to apply the settings.

##  Structural navigation for reading math in context 

1. Open a Word document on your Windows device, then press ALT + F to open the File menu.
2. Press T for Options. then press "a" twice to advanced.
3. Press tab into editing options.
4. Tab Show document content:
*uncheck - Show bookmarks
* Uncheck - Show field codes instead of their values. (Field codes interfere with math reading)
* check - Use smart cut and paste
Tab to OK to apply the settings.

## Enable feedback with sound and more logical navigation
1. Open a Word document on your Windows device, then press ALT + F to open the File menu.
2. Press T to open Options, and then press A for Accessibility options.
3. Tab to provide feedback with sound press the space bar to enable this.
4select modern
Most people prefer the modern sound scheme over the classic.
You will be able to hear a sound when entering and exiting an equation.
5. Press the Tab key until you get to the Use reading order for arrow key navigation check box, and then press Space to select it.  
This provides a better experience when arrowing up and down in a word document.
6. Tab to the OK button, and then press Enter to apply the change.




## Equation editing options

In the main body of the blank Word document, type alt + "=" (Alt plus the equal symbol.).
This places you inside the Word equation editing field. Type \sqrt 4 = 2. Notice that \sqrt becomes the square root symbol.

Now press alt and you will be taken to the equation tab. Press down arrow  and you will be in the options.
Right arrow and you will be in the selection for Unicode or LaTex. we suggest selecting unicode.  Set this as the default.

In the same area, press right arrow to the selection for conversions between linear or professional. Make linear the default.

When you go back to the main document and you are in the equation, hit alt again and check that Unicode and linear are the default options.

## Tips
ctrl + = puts it in professional
ctrl + shift + = puts it in linear

You can press ctrl + a to select all and then press ctrl + = to put all equations into professional for printing or to submit to others who will be expecting professional looking math.
