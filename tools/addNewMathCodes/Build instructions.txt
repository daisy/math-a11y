The PowerShell script has no external dependencies. It can be run in Windows Powershell using the command:
.\addmathcodes.ps1

To build the script into an executable, you can do the following:
Step 1: grab the PS2EXE utility (only need to do this once)
Install-Module -Name PS2EXE -Scope CurrentUser
Step 2: build the exe using the filename of the script and the filename of the desired executable
ps2exe addmathcodes.ps1 addmathcodes.exe -noConsole
